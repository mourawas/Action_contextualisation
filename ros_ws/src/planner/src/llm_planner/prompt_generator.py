    There is a robot, labeled 'robot', that can only manipulate ONE object at a time. The robot accepts commands in the form 'action functions' written in python. These action functions, which can be imported from the 'action_functions' library are:

    drop(location: str, speed: float, obstacle_clearance: float) -> None: # Goes to "loaction" and drops the grasped object over it. It is not advised to use the approach function directly before this one.

    approach(object_to_grasp: str, speed: float, obstacle_clearance: float, grasp: str) -> None:  # Moves the robot close to "object_to_grasp" so that the object is in robot's reach

    place(location: str, orientation: float, speed: float, obstacle_clearance: float) -> None: #Positions the "grasped_object" on/at/in the "location" and release the grasp. It is not advised to use the approach function directly before this one.

    pick(object_to_grasp: str, speed: float, obstacle_clearance: float, grasp: str) -> None: # Instructs the robot to pick up the "object_to_grasp", if it is close enough

    The "speed" argument for 'approach', 'pick', 'drop' and 'place' functions, assumes value in [0,1] and regulates how fast the robot moves. The closer the the value is to 1 the faster the robot moves. moving with higher speed is faster but might result in a jerky and less precise motion.

    The "orientation" argument for the 'place' and 'drop' function, regulates how crucial it is for the robot to maintain the original orientation of object that the robot is holding. A value closer to 1, instructs the robot to strictly maintain the orientation, but may result in difficulty to avoid external perturbations or obstacles .

    The "grasp" argument for 'approach' and 'pick' is mandatory and assumes one of the two values {"top", "side"}, never use None, where "top" instructs the robot to approach or pick the object from the top and selecting "side" instructs the robot to approach or pick the object from the side.

    The "obstacle_clearance" for 'drop', 'approach', 'place' and 'pick' functions defines how close the robot can get from an object (including the one it is trying to grasp in the pick action) before starting to avoid it. The distance is in meter. Small values allow the robot to get closer to obstacles and usually give a better chance of reaching the object, picking it and holding it. Typically values are between 0.005 and 0.05 although values out of this range are possible.

    The actions described in these functions are the only motions known to the robot. The task for the robot is: "{task}". First explain how you are going to solve the task, why each step is executed and how it makes sense to a human that you do it this way.

    Then, using the actions functions, 'objects' and 'locations', define a task plan as a Python list of tuples (named 'task_plan'), for the robot to follow. The action_functions from the task_plan will be directly run on the robot. Each element of the list is a tuple of the form (action number, action function name string, (arguments)). For each action, use object and task specific arguments.

    The first index of the plan should be 0.

    Take into account that some locations might be outside of the robot reach and you might only be able to use "drop" to put an object there.

    Do not make any assumptions. For the task plan, output a single code block. With each action include as the comment the reasoning behind the action and its parameters.

    Assume the necessary modules containing action functions have already been loaded. Write only a single assignment statement creating the full 'task_plan'

    Do not abbreviate anything in the code you are writing. No matter how long it is, write it in full.

    The robot may not be able to execute an action function, or encounter object collision during execution. Thus, it is required to check for completion of each action function after they have been performed.

    For this, we define some 'checking functions' written in python. These checking functions, which can be imported from the 'checking_functions' library are:

    can_grasp(object_to_grasp: str, grasp: str) -> bool: # Returns True if robot is close-enough to the "object_to_grasp" to securley grasp it with the determined grasp "side" or "top"

    holding() -> bool # Returns True if the robot is holding an object

    at_location(object: str, location: str) -> bool: # Returns True if the "object" is at the "location"

    collision_free() -> str: # If the robot encounters a collision while executing the preceding action, returns the object label string. Otherwise, ''.

    timeout() -> Bool: # Returns True if the preceding action was executed in a timely fashion

    check_motion_health() ->  bool: # Returns True if the robot's motion during the preceding action was safe for its hardware

    can_reach(goal: str, grasp: str) -> bool: # Returns True if it is feasible for the robot to reach the "goal" object or location from the current state from the side determined by the grasp argument "side" or "top". Objects that are out of the workspace will always return false.

    The grasp argument is the same as the one in the "approach" and "pick" functions. It assumes one of the two values {"top", "side"}

    Using the checking_functions, locations and objects, define an evaluation plan (named 'evaluation_plan') to verify the succesful execution of each action. Additionally, for each action verify without fail:
    - collision free
    - timely motion
    - motion health

    Output this plan as a Python list of tuples, where each tuple is of the form (action number int, dictionary with check_function names as keys and a tuple of arguments as value, tuple of expected outputs). Do not assume any other object or location, beyond those in object_labels.
    
    For functions that take no arguments (collision_free, timeout, check_motion_health, holding), use empty tuples () as the value. For functions that take arguments, use a tuple containing the arguments.

    Each tuple is meant to be checked after the acton with the corresponding number.

    Generate the entire plan. No reasoning, direct output.
